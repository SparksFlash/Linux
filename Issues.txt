The main usage of the mv command is to move a file or folder to another location. Here’s the syntax:

mv file_or_directory [target_directory]
1.ping: Checks network connectivity by sending ICMP echo requests
2.tar: Creates, extracts, and archives files.

3.The awk command searches and manipulates regular expression patterns in a file. Here’s the basic syntax:

awk '/regex pattern/{action}' input_file.txt




The tee command outputs another command’s results to both the Terminal and a file. It’s helpful if you want to use the data for further processing or backups. Here’s the syntax:

command | tee [options] file_name

For example, we will save the ping command’s output as new entries in the test_network.txt file:

ping 8.8.8.8 | tee -a test_network.txt
